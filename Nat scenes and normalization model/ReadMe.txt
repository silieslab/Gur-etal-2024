Fig 3. and Fig. 5. Analysis of natural scenes and neuron models. 

1. We have used two sets of natural scenes in [1]. Set 1: cd34B1_sunset_woods_lowlight. Set 2: cd35B_sky_horizon_allday.
2. To run the codes, the corresponding natural scenes must be downloaded from the original reference [1]. 
3. LMC model is available in the jupyter notebook "LMC_neurons"
4. The code to compute normalization responses downstream of LMC responses to Natural scenes is available in the python files "Normalizing_images.py" and "Normalizing_images_TrayectorySamples.py".
5. The analysis of contrast responses summarized in Fig. 3 is available in the jupyter notebook "Fig3_PoolingNatScenes" 
6. Normalization model of Tm1 and Tm9 neurons is available in the jupyter notebook "Fig5_NormalizationNeuronModel"
